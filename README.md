AMAZON MUSIC CLUSTERING ANALYSIS

This is an unsupervised model in the data to view the patterns and categorize songs based on their audio features.
By analyzing properties like energy, danceability, valence, and acousticness
•	Exploring the audio feature data
•	 Applying K-Means clustering to identify song groups
•	 Visualizing clusters through advanced plots
•	 Understanding how musical features relate to mood or genr

 Data Preprocessing
•	Cleaned and normalized dataset using StandardScaler
•	Features include: danceability, energy, loudness, speechiness, acouticness, instrumentalness, liveness, valence, temo, duration_min
•	Checked for missing values and handled outliers
Model Building — K-Means Clustering
•	Evaluated cluster performance using:
o	 Elbow Method 
o	 Silhouette Score
